    <p class="lead">The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has completed an initial review of the cockpit voice recorder from the Atlas Air Boeing 767-300ER Freighter that crashed southeast of Houston on 23 February, and will analyse the flight data recorder that was recovered on 3 March.</p>

<div class="container-fluid">
  <p><i>An analysis of Atlas Air Flight 3591's flight data recorder by the National Transportation Safety Board shows that the Boeing 767 experienced "small vertical accelerations" similar to what planes experience during turbulence shortly before it began to plunge into Trinity Bay around noon on Feb. 23.</p></i>

    <p> Air traffic control communications and radar data indicated the flight was normal from Miami to the Houston terminal area. About 12:30 pm the pilots contacted the Houston terminal radar approach control (TRACON) arrival controller and reported descending for runway 26L; the airplane was at 17,800 ft with a ground speed 320 knots. At 12:34, the airplane was descending through 13,800 ft, and the controller advised of an area of light to heavy precipitation along the flight route and that they could expect vectors around the weather.</p>
    <p>FDR, radar, and ADS-B data indicated that the airplane entered a rapid descent on a heading of 270, reaching an airspeed of about 430 knots. A security camera video captured the airplane in a steep, generally wings-level attitude until impact with the swamp. FDR data indicated that the airplane gradually pitched up to about 20 degrees nose down during the descent.</p>
